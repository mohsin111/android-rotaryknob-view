Here's a new dynamic control for Android: a Rotary Knob. It can be used to adjust a value similar to a slider, but it is circular and has a certain advantage when it comes to aesthetics.<br />
Additionally it can be made to accept clicks, so besides working as a slider it can also function as a button. Either a momentary push button or a switch that can be toggled on or off.<br /><br />

The control itself is comprised of a stator imageview and a rotor imageview, resembling the structure of motor. The rotor can be either clicked or touched to slide.<br /><br />
The final control looks like this:<br />
